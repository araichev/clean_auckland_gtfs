Clean Auckland GTFS
********************
Some Python 3.5+ tools for cleaning Auckland Transport GTFS feeds.
Such feeds can be found on `Transit Feeds here <transitfeeds.com/p/auckland-transport/124>`_, for example.

Cleaning involves

- Dropping school routes
- Aggregating GTFS routes by route short name so that GTFS routes match publicly-facing routes. Auckland does not have 2500 transit routes!
